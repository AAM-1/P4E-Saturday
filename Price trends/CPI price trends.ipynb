As an online site they might also want to know how this could inform the company's own pricing decisions. "

    "# Motivation \n",
    "\n",
    "The source of price rigidity is a foundational question in macroeconomics, and one which improvments in data is consistently shifting our understanding of. This data has been provided by Richard Davies (LSE), you can read more about how the dataset was constructed and the corresponding draft paper on his website [here.](https://richarddavies.io/research/the-uk-consumer-basket) \n",

    "### The data \n",
    "The price data come from monthly records of prices known as ‘price quotes’ that are recorded by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The price quotes files contain information on the item sold, its location, the shop and shop type (the size of the establishment) it is sold in, and whether it was offered at a sale or regular price. In the past year the ONS have also begun collecting prices from online retailers. The final raw data has over 32m observations. The dataset you will be using is not the original ONS price quotes data** but a smaller, cleaner sample with fewer basket items are available to download from [here.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w87w1o5dy0et2o0/everpresent10items%20.csv?dl=0) \n",
