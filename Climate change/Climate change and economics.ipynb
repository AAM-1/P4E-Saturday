    "This is for a python workshop with economics students to assess whether economists should suggest policies to address the climate crisis, and if so what these policies might cover. \n",

    "__The brief__\n",
    "\n",
    "You are an economics journalist at an international media outlet. Your team have closely followed the Bank of England's recent review on how climate change might affect the financial services sector. They are also looking at how the Bank can ensure financial resilience at the UK transitions to a low carbon economy. Some groups have been critical of this approach and about economists getting involved in climate change discussion generally. You are asked to research why there might there a case for economists to prioritise work on the climate crisis.\n",

    "# Motivation \n",
    "Discussions have been growing on the climate emergency with movements like Extinction Rebellion amplifying this issue. The UK will be hosting the UN's Climate Change Conference (COP26) in November, where the international community will be expected to reflect on the state of the environment. This is an ongoing area of discussion for economists and is often seen through the lens of a global market failure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__The Stern Review__\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2007 the Stern Review, authored by economist Nicholas Stern (LSE), determined that 'climate change is the greatest and widest-ranging market failure ever seen, presenting a unique challenge for economics'. The Stern Review estimated that the overall costs of climate change if no preventative action were taken would be equivalent to losing at least 5% of global gross domestic product (GDP) each year, now and forever. When considering a wider range of risks and impacts, these costs could rise to 20% of GDP or more. While it was not the first report on the economics of climate change it is the most popular and widely known. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Discount rates__\n",
    "\n",
    "A hallmark of the Review was the use of particular discount rates, and has continued to be a topic of great debate. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Stern Review argued that standard treatments of discounting were valuable for analysing marginal projects, but inappropriate for the non-marginal impacts important for many aspects of climate change. Cameron Hepburn argued that the relevant discount rate for climate change decisions should reflect the risk of “societal collapse” (for example, an entire region or country succumbing to rising sea levels) and, on this basis, should indeed be smaller than the current Treasury rate of 1.5% and possibly 0% to a first approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "William Nordhaus wrote that the Stern Review should be viewed as a political document, rather than an academic study. Claiming, like most government reports it was published without an appraisal of methods and assumptions by independent outside experts.\n",

    "## Related literature \n",
    "For the purposes of this exercise, students should only skim one or two of these papers to inform their analysis and presentations. You are also welcome to use theory and knowledge from your own studies. \n",
